# PHP Dasar
This repository contains the files of code that I have written as I follow along with Sandhika Galih's YouTube series titled "PHP Dasar".<br>
It will be updated as the class progresses. <br>
Detailed syllabus and lecture notes can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFIM0718LjIUqXfmEIBE3-uzERZPh3vp6).<br>
For this course, I use [PHP 7.2.11] (http://php.net/downloads.php)
For setup instruction and the list of dependencies, please see the setup folder of this repository.
